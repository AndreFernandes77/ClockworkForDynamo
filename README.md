DynamoSamples
=============

Some samples for the Dynamo visual programming environment.

Directory "package_samples" contains simple examples for all of the Dynamo packages I have published through the package manager so far.

Directory "workflow_samples" contains some up to date sample workflows that I have published online somewhere before. I have also started to include some of the examples that I use for teaching Dynamo.
