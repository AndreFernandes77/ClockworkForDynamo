Some samples for the [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.org) visual programming environment. All of these were only tested in Revit 2014 so they may not work in other environments.

Directory [package_samples](https://github.com/andydandy74/DynamoSamples/tree/master/package_samples) contains simple examples for all of the Dynamo packages I have published through the [package manager](http://www.dynamopackages.com) so far.

Directory [workflow_samples](https://github.com/andydandy74/DynamoSamples/tree/master/workflow_samples) contains some up-to-date sample workflows that I have published online somewhere before. I have also started to include some of the examples that I use for teaching Dynamo.

All samples should usually work best with one of the latest [daily builds](http://www.dynamobuilds.com) installed.

#Packages or Package Samples that need fixing in 0.6.3#

- Buckyball (project environment sample)
- Central Projection On Face
- Central Projection On Plane
- Has Out Of Plane XYZs
- Move XYZs From Plane To Plane

#Planned Improvements#

These are some improvements I'd like to add to existing packages if I should find the time. Feel free to suggest other improvements [here](https://github.com/andydandy74/DynamoSamples/issues).

- Intersects For Divided Surfaces: Horizontal Intersects only works in metric feet...
- Move XYZs From Plane To Plane: Simplify if possible & also return transform
- Solve Triangle By XYZs: Circumcenter & orthocenter

#Planned Packages#

Some ideas for packages that I didn't need yet but I think would be nice to have. I'd like to get around to making these eventually...

- Find Closest Point On Surface
- Solve Quadrilateral By XYZs
- Measure Curvature
- Archimedian Solids
