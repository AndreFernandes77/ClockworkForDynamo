DynamoSamples
=============

Some samples for the Dynamo visual programming environment.

Directory "package_samples" contains simple examples for some of the Dynamo packages I have authored. I am planning to create an example for each package. Currently I have covered roughly over 50%.

Directory "workflow_samples" contains some up to date sample worksflows that I have published online somewhere before. In the future I plan to also include more samples that I use for teaching Dynamo.
