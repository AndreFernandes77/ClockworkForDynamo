Some samples for the [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.org) visual programming environment.

Directory *package_samples* contains simple examples for all of the Dynamo packages I have published through the package manager so far.

Directory *workflow_samples* contains some up-to-date sample workflows that I have published online somewhere before. I have also started to include some of the examples that I use for teaching Dynamo.
