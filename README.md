Some samples for the [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.org) visual programming environment.

Directory [package_samples](https://github.com/andydandy74/DynamoSamples/tree/master/package_samples) contains simple examples for all of the Dynamo packages I have published through the [package manager](http://www.dynamopackages.com/) so far.

Directory [workflow_samples](https://github.com/andydandy74/DynamoSamples/tree/master/workflow_samples) contains some up-to-date sample workflows that I have published online somewhere before. I have also started to include some of the examples that I use for teaching Dynamo.

All samples should usually work best with one of the latest [daily builds](http://dyn-builds-pub.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/) installed.
