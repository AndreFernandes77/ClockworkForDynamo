DynamoSamples
=============

Some samples for the Dynamo visual programming environment.

Directory "package_samples" contains simple examples for most of the Dynamo packages I have authored. I plan to create an example for each package. Currently I have covered roughly over 95%, so I'm almost there...

Directory "workflow_samples" contains some up to date sample worksflows that I have published online somewhere before. I have also started to include some of the samples that I use for teaching Dynamo.
