Some simple rules for posting issues and pull requests for Clockwork for Dynamo

### Issues
- **When posting bugs: Describe what you were doing, what went wrong and what you were expecting to happen.** Include screenshots where applicable.
- **Also when posting bugs: Describe your setup.** (Operating Sytem, Dynamo version, Revit version & build number) If you're using a daily build, please include the filename of the installer.
- **When posting wishes: Go wild.** After all, it's a wish, right?
- **Make sure you are running one of the *supported* Clockwork versions and it's the *latest available version** (see https://github.com/andydandy74/ClockworkForDynamo#versions)
- **Make sure your installed version of Clockwork matches the Dynamo version it's installed for** (e.g. Clockwork for Dynamo 0.9.x is *not* installed for Dynamo 1.x)
- **Make sure you do *not* have multiple versions of Clockwork installed for one Dynamo version** (e.g. Clockwork for Dynamo 1.x and Clockwork for Dynamo 0.9.x installed for the same Dynamo version). Please check your packages folder!

### Pull Requests
- **Describe the purpose of your PR and what you have changed in the original code.**
- **Do *not* submit anything authored in a post-1.0.0 build** (build numbers larger than 1.0.0.1180).
- **Make sure you are running the *supported* Clockwork versions and it's the *latest available version** (see https://github.com/andydandy74/ClockworkForDynamo#versions)
